    Todo

        MinimuuM:
            next step should be to start adding tests
            jumping pieces/stop pieces jumping
                error check
            endings:victory/draw
            pawn to queen
            castling
                    need to check if pieces havent move and if havent castled
                    need to add test
                left side castling
            check and check rules
            bugs-pawn with something too in frount?,rook moving backwards? knight blocked bishop when not supposed to down-left?
                queen moving 2spaces too little.
            deleate table at end of tests         
            clean up code       

        Possible additons:    
            make cell amount custimizable
            make peice unselect automatic if piece can not move
            add table items into an array so you dont have to recreate table in js every time you acsess it
            connect an ai
            click on piece twice to deselect
            refactor restart game function in main.js
            make chess board size responsive
