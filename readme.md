    Todo

        MinimuuM:
            next step should be to start adding tests
            jumping pieces/stop pieces jumping
                pawn double no jump
                error check
            endings:victory/draw
            pawn to queen
            castling
            check and check rules
            bugs-pawn with something too in frount?,rook moving backwards? knight blocked bishop when not supposed to down-left?
                queen moving 2spaces too little.
            install node and test-test onclicks by calling the cell clicked function
                

        Possible additons:    
            make cell amount custimizable
            make peice unselect automatic if piece can not move
            add table items into an array so you dont have to recreate table in js every time you acsess it
